            to the common concerns and inquiries

        <button id="question-one">What is special about comparing rental car deals?</button>
        <div id="question-one-answer">
            <p>
                Comparing rental car deals is essential because it allows you to make an informed
                decision about which rental car company to choose, which car to rent, and which
                deal to take advantage of. When it comes to renting a car, prices can vary 
                significantly based on the rental company, the location, the type of car, 
                the time of year, and the length of the rental.
            </p>
            <p>
                By comparing rental car deals, you can find the best possible rates for the car 
                you want to rent. You can also compare the terms and conditions of each deal, 
                such as the mileage allowance, the insurance coverage, and any additional fees 
                or charges that may apply. This can help you avoid any surprises or hidden 
                costs when you pick up your rental car.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to price and terms, comparing rental car deals also allows you 
                to choose a rental company that has a good reputation for customer service 
                and reliability. By reading reviews and comparing ratings, you can find a 
                rental company that has a history of providing excellent service and reliable 
                vehicles. This can give you peace of mind and ensure that you have a positive 
                rental experience.

        <button id="question-two">How do i find the car rental deals?</button>
        <div id="question-two-answer">
            <p>
                There are several ways to find car rental deals. One of the easiest and most 
                convenient ways is to use online travel booking sites. These sites allow you 
                to compare prices and rental options from different car rental companies in 
                one place. You can also use search engines to find car rental companies in 
                your desired location and compare their prices and rental options.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another way to find car rental deals is to sign up for loyalty programs and 
                newsletters from car rental companies. These programs and newsletters often 
                offer exclusive deals, discounts, and promotional codes for their subscribers.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's also a good idea to book your car rental in advance. Many car rental 
                companies offer discounts for early bookings or extended rentals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, you can also consider using third-party booking sites that offer 
                discount codes or cashback offers. These sites can help you save money on your 
                car rental and often have exclusive deals with car rental companies. However, 
                it's important to read the fine print and terms and conditions before booking 
                to ensure that you are getting the best deal and are aware of any restrictions 
                or fees.
            </p>
        </div>
        <button id="question-three">How do i find such low rental car prices?</button>
        <div id="question-two-answer">
            <p>
                There are several ways to find low rental car prices. Here are some tips:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Book early: The earlier you book your rental car, the more likely you 
                    are to find a better deal. Rental car prices tend to go up as the date 
                    approaches, so booking early can save you a lot of money.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Compare prices: There are many rental car companies out there, and each 
                    one has its own pricing structure. Use online travel agencies or comparison 
                    sites to compare prices from multiple rental car companies at once. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Look for discounts: Rental car companies offer discounts for a variety of 
                    reasons, such as AAA membership, military service, and senior citizen status.
                    Be sure to check for any available discounts that you may be eligible for.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Consider off-airport locations: Rental car prices at airport locations tend 
                    to be higher due to airport fees. Consider renting a car from a location 
                    off-airport, which can often result in significant savings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Be flexible: Being flexible with your travel dates and pickup/dropoff 
                    locations can also help you find lower rental car prices. Try adjusting 
                    your travel plans to see if you can get a better deal.
